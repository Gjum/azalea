`azalea_client` is a crate that uses [`azalea_protocol`] that provides [`bevy_ecs`] plugins for making Minecraft clients.
For making Minecraft *bots*, you should look at [`azalea`] instead, which is a higher-level crate that uses `azalea_client` under the hood and provides extra utilities that are specifically useful for bots.
